# Authentication

Authentication for all endpoints are done by including a token in either the header or as a query parameter.

{% method %}

## Token

{% sample lang="bash" %}
Provide the token in the header:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Authorization : Bearer <token>" ...
```

Or in a query parameter:

```bash
$ curl -X POST "...?token=<token>"
```
{% endmethod %}

{% method %}

## Generation of tokens

A token can be generated by invoking the `token` endpoint on a given individual.

Tokens are generated with a few properties set.

 * `exp` expiration date, you can supply your own value (as a unix epoch)
 * 

{% sample lang="bash" %}

```bash
$ curl -X POST ../individual/0xfo1/token
```

A token will then asynchronously get sent to the email specified for that user.

{% endmethod %}
